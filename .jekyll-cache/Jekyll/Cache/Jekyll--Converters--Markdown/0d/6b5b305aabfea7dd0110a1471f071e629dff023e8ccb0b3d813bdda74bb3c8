<ul>
  <li>ESP32 Development board. There are many variants available but make sure GPIO pins 16 (TX2) and 17 (RX2) (Serial Port 2) are exposed. The ESP32 has two hardware serial ports and we will be using Serial Port 2 to connect the Flex RF module, so that you can use Serial Port 1 for debugging.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/accessories/products/400-point-prototyping-breadboard">Breadboard</a>(optional if you want to interface JemRF sensors) for easy installation. Both the ESP32 Development Board and the Flex Module are designed for prototyping breadboards but, of course, could be soldered together if that is your preference.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/accessories/products/jumper-wires">Jumper wires</a></li>
  <li>Micro USB to USB 2.0 connector to connect the ESP32 to a PC</li>
  <li>A PC is required to load firmware on the ESP32. We will be using the Arduino IDE that has client available for Windows, Mac or Linux.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/accessories/products/ds18b20-dallas-1-wire-digital-temperature-sensor-and-resistor">DS18B20 sensor</a>, or <a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/accessories/products/copy-of-ds18b20-dallas-1-wire-digital-temperature-sensor-and-resistor">DS1820 waterproof sensor</a>,</li>
  <li>4.7k Ohm resistor</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some basic low voltage electrical experience is advantageous but not necessary. The electrical construction is very basic and could be achieved with no knowledge of electronics.</li>
  <li>Some basic programming knowledge and prior experience with the Arduino IDE. Again not absolutely necessary but it will make the learning curve a bit easier.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-1---wiring">Step 1 - Wiring</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The DS18B20 sensor has three connections : VDD, DATA and GND. As per the following picture make the four connections between the DS18B20 sensor and the ESP32 Development Board:</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Connect ESP32 GND to the left most pin on the DS18B20 (or the black wire on waterproof sensor)</li>
  <li>Connect ESP32 D4 pin to the middle pin on the DS18B20 (or yellow wire on the waterproof sensor)</li>
  <li>Connect ESP32 3V3 pin to the rightmost pin on the DS18B20 (or red wire on the waterproof sensor)

<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Connect the 4.7k Ohm resistor between VDD and DATA
