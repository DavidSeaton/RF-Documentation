I"ù<p>All of the RF modules can be configured to operate in different modes that determine the how the device
will operate.</p>

<p>There are two modes of operation:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Gateway Mode.</strong> In Gateway Mode the device acts as Serial to Radio / Radio to Serial converter. Messages sent to the serial port are transmitted through the radio. Incoming messages from the Radio are sent through the Serial port. One of the main characteristics of Gateway mode is the serial port. The RF module must be connected to the serial port of the micro-controller (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32‚Ä¶). A Gateway is always awake ,cannot be put into a low lower sleep and is usually powered by a dedicated power supply.</li>

  <li><strong>Sensor Mode.</strong> The device can sleep which allows it to operate for long periods of time consuming very little power (0.5 ¬µA). The device is awoken either by an external event (e.g. door switch) or an internal timer that causes the device to wake up, send some data, and then go back to sleep. A device in sensor mode can also be attached to an external power supply and be always awake. When the device is awake it can receive and process radio messages. In this way a request/reply messaging model is created where a Gateway requests data from the sensor nodes.</li>
